Spreadsheets are arguably the most accessible method for ~~calculations, reports, analysis~~ data manipulation on computers and Excel is by far the most commonly used spreadsheeting solution.
<!--more-->

This popularity is both a blessing and a curse; almost anyone with a PC begins spreadsheeting withouth realizing the risks.

I also intend this page to serve as an open record of quality content reqgaridng the "philosophy" of spreadsheeting that I've come across. I hope to spark a discussion about spreadsheets!

### Spreadsheeting
Spreadsheets need to be viewed in a different light. [Dr. Felienne Hermans](https://www.felienne.com/about) and her work with spreadsheets ought to be recommended reading for every spreadsheet enthusiast.
